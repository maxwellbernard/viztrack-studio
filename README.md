# Viztrack Studio App
👋 Welcome to the Viztrack Studio App! This web app allows you to visualize your Spotify data in a fun and interactive way.

The user has the ability to select how many items they want to visualize, and whether it's artists, songs, or albums. The app generates both static images and animations! 🎵🎵

Top 5 Artists you've ever listened to? Top 10 Songs? Top 3 Albums you've listened to the most this decade? The app can visualize all of this data and allow you to share it with your friends in a social media friendly format! 

The web app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and you can access it [here](https://maxwell-bernard-spotify-animation-app.streamlit.app/).
